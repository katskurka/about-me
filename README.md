<h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
<p>Hey there! My name is Kat and Iâ€™m a New England native currently living in Rhode Island. Last year I viewed Newport, RI as the birds do by skydiving for the first time (<em>lifelong fear of heights conquered!</em>).</p> 
<p>When not in front of a computer monitor, I love surfing and hiking with my three pups who are the fluffiest Belgian Shepherds to ever be used as pillows.</p>
