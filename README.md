# About Me
Hey there! My name is Kat and Iâ€™m a New England native currently living in Rhode Island. Last year I viewed Newport, RI as the birds do by skydiving for the first time (*lifelong fear of heights conquered!*). 

When not in front of a computer monitor, I love surfing and hiking with my three pups who are the fluffiest Belgian Shepherds to ever be used as pillows.
